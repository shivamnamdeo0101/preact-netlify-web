It was scheduled in the morning just for 25 -30 min something.

1. Introduce Yourself.
2. Your Project second question is based on what you have mentioned in your first answer to the question “ Tell me about yourself”.
3. Tech Stack, you have worked on.
4. Your project in detail.

If you are having your project just make sure you don't forget to share it with the interviewer. I followed some youtube videos for maths reasoning and prepinsta free videos resources. Follow some websites and in the interview just make eye contact with the interviewer and be confident in your answer. I also practiced for 1 month and I was also having projects in react and firebase which helped me a lot in the interview.
